## About subgenres
This field reflects the subgenre of experimental music being performed. Given the inherently subjective nature of this field combined with a need for usability, I have limited the number of terms I’ve used in this field. Other catalogers adding to this collection should first consult this list before adding additional subgenres. Copy exactly and separate by semicolon. For posters, include all genres featured in the promoted show.

### Ambient Noise
Describes soundscapes created through intermittent otherwise non-musical interjections, as in, not connected to traditional rhythm, pitch, or familiar timbres. “Ambient noise” is distinguished from traditional “noise” music for its less aggressive texture, allowing the listener to perceive discrete elements while also wading through a constructed whole. 

### Electro-acoustic improvisation
Describes the practice of improvisation with acoustic instruments as well as electronic ones, which may include amplified and processed instruments, pre-recorded samples, and synthesized sounds. The term also implies a meterless, post-tonal and “post-jazz” approach.

### Noise Rock
Describes music that employs the aggression of noise music obtained through excessive distortion and feedback, within the blues-derived and the beat-driven, metered framework of rock music, as well as its traditional instrumentation of guitars and drums. 

### Free Improvisation
Describes music made through instantaneous live composition, primarily with acoustic or electrified instruments. Implies a meterless, post-tonal approach, but may incorporate these elements as part of a broader palette. 

### Psychedelic Rock
Describes a subgenre of rock music that shares its blues-derived, beat-driven and metered rhythmic framework and use of the diatonic chord progression or blues modes, as well as traditional instrumentation of guitars and drums, but may contain more indulgent and fuller textures, slower tempos, dreamier lyrics and vocal delivery, and incorporation of extended improvisatory instrumental passages. 

### Ambient 
Describes soundscapes created through synthesis, prerecorded samples, processed instruments or live instruments. It is distinct from “ambient noise” for its continuous texture with less interjection, increased focus on musicality through pitch or planned texture, and normally omits percussion.

### Poster
Term to separate posters from performance images and videos.
