## About the Collection

“Sounds from the Black Hole” is an ongoing concert series for experimental music, particularly electro-acoustic improvisation, organized by Ben Myers, centralized in Bloomington, Indiana. While the series has been active for several years, more regular performances in a greater variety of venues have cropped up over the last two years, which also coincides with my time spent in Bloomington, making a focus limited to 2024 and 2025 most reasonable for this collection. Shows are typically at least once a month, featuring local artists as well as at least one touring artist. This collection contains a sampling of images and videos from various performances from within the concert series ranging over 2024 and 2025, as well as promotional materials, representing its flourishing history over the past two years. Metadata describing each detail of the performances creates a historic web and a unifying image of the development of one of the Midwest’s most unique music scenes.
